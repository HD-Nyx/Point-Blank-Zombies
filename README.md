# Point-Blank-Zombies
Recreating call of duty zombies in minecraft using point blank as the gun system and CC:Tweaked as logic handling.

Currently it is not done.

Requries Minecraft 1.20.1, Fabric/Forge/NeoForge mod loaders and [CC:Tweaked](https://modrinth.com/mod/cc-tweaked) ([Entity Texture Features](https://modrinth.com/mod/entitytexturefeatures) is needed for the modifed resoursepack)

Optionally you can use [Vic's Point Blank](https://modrinth.com/mod/vics-point-blank) for guns without needing to modfiy the code.

[Axiom](https://modrinth.com/mod/axiom) is great for creating display entites and that is what I'm going to be using for my own map (if you are going to use forge/neoforge then you need to install [Sinytra Connecter](https://modrinth.com/mod/connector) + [Forgified Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/forgified-fabric-api) and [Connector Extras](https://modrinth.com/mod/connector-extras)
