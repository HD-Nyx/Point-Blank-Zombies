# Point-Blank-Zombies
Recreating a zombie game that is like call of duty zombies in minecraft using point blank as the gun system and CC:Tweaked as logic handling.

Currently the code and the resoursepack is not done, I will make a release once it is ready.

[Subject to change] The resoursepack will be using [Tissou's Zombie Pack](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/tissous-zombie-pack-optifine-1-7x-1-20) and [SKT - Desaturated Vanilla](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/skt-desaturated-vanilla) + my own additions like sounds and music

Requries Minecraft 1.20.1, Fabric/Forge/NeoForge mod loaders and [CC:Tweaked](https://modrinth.com/mod/cc-tweaked) ([Entity Texture Features](https://modrinth.com/mod/entitytexturefeatures) is needed for the modifed resoursepack)

Optionally you can use [Vic's Point Blank](https://modrinth.com/mod/vics-point-blank) for guns without needing to modfiy the code.

[Axiom](https://modrinth.com/mod/axiom) is great for creating display entites and that is what I'm going to be using for my own map (if you are going to use forge/neoforge then you need to install [Sinytra Connecter](https://modrinth.com/mod/connector) + [Forgified Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/forgified-fabric-api) and [Connector Extras](https://modrinth.com/mod/connector-extras)
