# Point-Blank-Zombies
Recreating call of duty zombies in minecraft using point blank as the gun system and CC:Tweaked as logic handling.

Currently it is not done.

Requries Minecraft 1.20.1 and CC:Tweaked

Optionally you can use Vic's Point Blank for guns without needing to mdofiy the code.

Axiom is great for creating display entites and that is what I'm going to be using for my own map
